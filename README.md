# dhis2-server-tools
Tools to support installation and management of DHIS2 and its components,i.e
postgres database, proxy and monitoring with ansible.

## Introduction
DHIS2 is an open-source Health Information System application.This
document is gives step by step guide on its installation with ansible. The
scripts sets up the app on two scenarios. 
1. setup on a single ubuntu server<br> 
   This setup uses lxd containers, ansible_connection used is lxd.
2. Setup on multiple servers.<br> 
   Here, dhis2 application stack, i.e database, apps and proxy, is setup on
   different server and the communication between them happens over the
   network.

## Pre-requisites 
* A fully qualified domain name (fqdn) resolving to proxy's public ip address
  in case of a disturbed setup, or dhis2 servers public address on single
  server setup.
* SSL/TLS certificate - The install defaults to obtaining ssl/TLS certificate
  from letsencrypt, however, you could also use custom  SSL/TLS certificate. 
* ubuntu server running 20.04.  
* non-root user with sudo privileges 
* access to the server, can ssh or console access. 
* internet access on the servers.

## Installation
Pull deployment the code from git, make a few required configuration changes
and run them for the installation. Ansible automation tool is used to run the
scripts,it has to be installed on the deployment server. The scripts work two
deployment scenarios which can either be on a single server or on a
distributed/multiple servers/vms.  For dhis2 deployment on multiple servers,
you'll need a small deployment server, with ssh access to all the other
servers, underlying connection used is ssh.

### Step1 :- Install ansible and other dependencies
#### ansible setup, 
_**NOTE:** In case of distributed/multiple server setup, this will be the deployment server._ <br> 
update and upgrade system packages <br>
```
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y upgrade
```

<br>ensure git is installed <br>
`sudo apt install -y git`

Install ansible version **_2.11_** or above, to work with community.general modules.

```
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install -y ansible
sudo apt-get install -y python3-netaddr
```
Install community.general ansible modules, required for lxd_container, ufw and other modules <br>
`ansible-galaxy collection install community.general -f`

### Step2 :- Pull ansible deployment code from git
`git clone https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-server-tools`


### Step3:- Customization before installation
Change the directory to the project directory
```
cd dhis2-server-tools
```

edit the file  `dhis2-server-toos/deploy/inventory/hosts`. The file has a list
of hosts, which can be physical/virtual servers depending on
your setup. Change ip address for these hosts to suite your environment,

_**NOTE**: `When setup is on a single host, ensure your host gateway or any
other address is not on lxd network subnet. You could change lxd network
address space to something else`_ <br> 

Use an editor of your choice, here we are using vim, you could use `nano` as well. <br> 
`vim dhis2-server-tools/deploy/inventory/hosts`

```
[proxy]
proxy       ansible_host=192.168.0.2    ssh_port=22
[databases]
postgres    ansible_host=192.168.0.20  ssh_port=22
[instances]
dhis2   ansible_host=192.168.0.10  database_host=postgres   proxy_is_enabled=True
tracker ansible_host=192.168.0.11  database_host=postgres   proxy_is_enabled=True
[monitoring]
```
####  Configuration parameters 
dhis2-server-tools configurations are located on the inventory file on
`dhis2-server-tools/deploy/inventory/hosts` file.
Below is a list of available configuration parameters
##### mandatory parameters 
* `fqdn` this is the domain used to access dhis2 application 
* `email` This is an email used to generate letsecrypt certificate and Let's
  Encrypt expiration emails
* `ansible_connection=lxd` Depending on the setup environment, ansible_connection
  can be `lxd` or `ssh`, ssh if its on multiple server and lxd if on a single
  server 

_Important: dhis2 is designed to work on the dedicated domain. You can use
either a domain like yourdomain.com or a subdomain of any level. During the
installation, the install checks the existence of the domain name entered
(otherwise proxy setup is aborted). Therefore, you need to create and setup a
(sub)domain so it is resolved to an external IP address of your server._

##### optional parameters 
* `proxy=nginx`  here you specify proxy software of your choice, can be nginx
  or apache2 default is nginx, only nginx supported for now. 
* `SSL_TYPE=letsencrypt` this parameter enables to specify whether you'd want
  to use `letsencrypt` or your own `customssl` certificate, defaults is
  letsencrypt 
* `timezone=Africa/Nairobi` You set this variable to your home/city's time zone. 

* `lxd_network="192.168.0.1/24"`, here you define a network which your
  containers will be created into.
* `lxd_bridge_interface=lxdbr0`, the name of the created lxd bridge
* `create_db=yes` , whether dhis2 install should create new db or not, 
* `JAVA_VERSION="11"` version of java to be install, defaults to java11
* `dhis2_war_file` This is were you specify dhis2 war file, its can be a
  url or a file,the file full path must be specified, alternatively, you can
  place the file in
  dhis2-server-tools/deploy/dhis2/files directory and you'll not be required to
  specify its path but just the name. 
* `database_host=postgres` this is the database server that the instance should
  use, defaults to postgres. Must be also defined on you inventory file. 

#### hosts grouping
The host are grouped into categories below, 
* `[proxy]` - These are the servers that are used to access dhis2 application
  from the outside. Public ip address is mapped to this host. In most cases
  itâ€™s just a single host but you can have multiple servers as well.
* `[database]` - This is a group of servers that are used to host the databases,
  which is postgresql in our case. It can be one or many as well.
* `[instances]` - Servers intended for installing dhis2 web  application will be
  under this group.
* `[monitoring]`  - Servers intended for monitoring.


### Step4: Running the scripts, the installation
#### DHIS2 setup on a single host with lxd 
To install dhis2 on a single server (lxd), ensure your ansible_connection parameter is set to lxd<br>
`ansible_connection=lxd` <br>
Run below two playbooks on the host where you'll be setting up dhis2

`ansible-playbook deploy/lxd-init.yml` # needed to setup lxd environment. <br>
`ansible-playbook deploy/dhis2.yaml -i ./deploy/inventory/hosts `

#### DHIS2 install on multiple servers
You'll need a deployment server for this architecture. There should be ssh
access from the deployment server to all the server components where you'll be
having dhis2 application stack components. 
Ensure ansible_connection parameter is set to ssh, i.e` ansible_connection=ssh` then run the playbook below. 

`ansible-playbook deploy/dhis2.yaml -i ./deploy/inventory/hosts -u <ssh_user> -Kk`

NOTE: Since connection used is ssh, you'll need to pass connection parameters
on the command line, i.e ssh_username with `-u`, ssh_password with `-k` and
become_password  with `-k`

## Using a Custom SSL Certificate 
##### ENSURE YOU HAVE SSL/TLS Certificate and key beforehand
For HTTPS connection, the install used Letsencrypt to obtain an SSL/TLS certificate. This
should work fine most OS and browsers, however, these scripts provides a way of
using your own SSL/TLS certificates. To use your own custom SSL/TLS certs, follow below steps, 

1. Get/generate `fullchain.pem` file which will be concatenating your certificate
   and any other intermediate and root certificates.
2. Get/generate `privkey.pem` file, this contains private key used for certificate signing.
3. Copy these two files into `dhis2-server-tools/deploy/roles/proxy/files/` directory.
4. edit `dhis2-server-tools/deploy/inventory/hosts` and change `SSL_TYPE`  to `customssl` 

To start using a custom certificate instead of the default Letsencrypt
certificate, you need to switch off the certbot service in the `/deploy/inventory/hosts` 
configuration and ensure you have both `fullchain.pem` and `private.pem` files

## Customizing postgresql
Installed postgresql database comes with default settings which should be fine
and working at this stage. However, these settings can be changed a bit for
performance optimization and maximum utilization of the available system
resources. Before optimizing anything, you will need to know resources you have
first, i.e, total RAM  available, use `free -h` for that.

#### limiting  RAM exposed to postgresql container, only applies for lxd setup
Deciding how much RAM to dedicate to postgresql depends a little on how many
DHIS2 instances you are likely to run, but assuming you will have a production
instance and perhaps a small test instance,if you gave a total of say 32GB,
giving 16GB exclusively to postgresql is a reasonable start.

`sudo lxc config set postgresql limits.memory 16GB`

running `free -gh` inside the postgresql container you will see that it no
longer can see the full amount of RAM, but has been confined to 16GB. (try sudo
lxc exec postgres -- free -gh).

#### Editing postgresql configuration, applies for both both lxd and ssh setup.

Depending on your setup, postgresql can be on either the containers or on its own server,
To access the container  `sudo lxc exec postgres bash`

Access postgresql server from the deployment server with `ssh ssh_user@postgresql_server_ip -p ssh_port`

The file where all your custom settings are made is called `/etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf`
The default contents of this file is shown below:

```
# Postgresql settings for DHIS2

# Adjust depending on number of DHIS2 instances and their pool size
# By default each instance requires up to 80 connections
# This might be different if you have set pool in dhis.conf
max_connections = 200

# Tune these according to your environment
# About 25% available RAM for postgres
# shared_buffers = 3GB

# Multiply by max_connections to know potentially how much RAM is required
# work_mem=20MB

# As much as you can reasonably afford.  Helps with index generation
# during the analytics generation task
# maintenance_work_mem=512MB

# Approx 80% of (Available RAM - maintenance_work_mem - max_connections*work_mem)
# effective_cache_size=8GB

# This setting is suitable for good SSD disk.  For slower spinning disk consider
# changing to 4
random_page_cost = 1.1

checkpoint_completion_target = 0.8
synchronous_commit = off
log_min_duration_statement = 300s
max_locks_per_transaction = 1024
```

The 4 settings that you should uncomment and give values to are
`shared_buffers, work_mem, maintenance_work_mem` and `effective_cache_size`.
If your database have say, 16GB of RAM reserved, It will be reasonable having
below settings
```
shared_buffers = 4GB
work_mem=20MB
maintenance_work_mem=1GB
effective_cache_size=11GB
```
For these changes to take effect, to restart the database and the dhis2 in that
order, for lxd setup, just restarting the containers restarts the apps. 
#### lxd setup restart example 
```
sudo lxc stop <dhis2_container>
sudo lxc restart postgres
sudo lxc start covid19
```

#### application management on the distributed architecture. 
for dhis2 setup in a distributed architecture, you'll have to logging to the
individual server and restart respective application. 
to restart postgres database, login to the server via ssh and run the command
below, 

   ```
   systemctl  stop  postgresql
   systemctl  start   postgresql
   systemctl  restart postgresql # this restarts the database with a sigle command 
   ```
To restart dhis2 instance, login to the server and use systemctl to restart
tomcat service by either stopping and starting or restarting with a single
command. 
   ```
   systemctl  stop tomcat9 
   systemctl  start tomcat9 
   ```
You can restart with below single command<br>
 `systemctl  restart tomcat9` 
   

Postgresql is an extremely customizable  database with multiple configuration
parameters. This brief installation guide only touches on the most important
tunables.

## lxd container operation
lxd environment offers `lxc` command line tool which can be used to manage and
administer containers 

listing containers <br>
`lxc list`
```

stop a container <br>
`lxc stop <container_name>`

restart container <br> 
`lxc restart <container_name>`

deletes a container<br>
`lxc delete <container_name>`
## MONITORING
By default the script implements monitoring with munin and glowroot. Munin is
for server monitoring whereas glowroot is for tomcat application monitoring.  

## NOTE: Work in progress. <br/>
